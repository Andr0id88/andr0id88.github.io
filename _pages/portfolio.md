    title: "About me"
    excerpt: 'I have used linux for 15+ years and i love making systems more efficent, be that my work laptop - or automating mutliple servers using new tech. Only recently i have turned my passion and hobby into my work, but dont let my little work experince fool you for what i am actually capable of. I like to see myself as a person that think out of the box when it comes to working efficent on linux - and i trive in the terminal. Ncurses, shellscripts yes please - if i get a task that revolves clicking in a GUI you can bet money on that the repetative task will be automated one way or the other.'

## Projects
I have been a part of many minor and larger projects in the last years, here are some of the projects i have been a part of.
#### Redhat satellite
The biggest project was setting up RedHat satellite alone for over 1000 servers within the health sector in norway. This project will be ongoing as long as i work here since there are new teams and new problems to solve and automate every day. Satellite was set up by mixed automation between puppet, ansible and some shellscripts aswell.
#### Redhat insights
I also took it upon myself to introduce redhat insights along with satellite to the organization, and i have been working continiously to improve the integration of the insights service with the rest of our platform. This is to provide a secure platform and to enable the our security team and others to quickly identify new treaths that occur.
#### Ansible automation platform
I am currently working on setting up Ansible Automation Plattform to provide a whole new service for all of our employees. The plan is to integrate this with Satellite aswell as insights to provide a automated errata and remediation service to our linux platform.
#### Linux work surface
When i started in NHN Linux as a office computer was unheard of and a dream. I can now proudly say that since that day i have become involved in a huge project that aims to change that. We are in the late stages of beeing able to offer linux as a work laptop and satellite and insights will be a big part of making that happen. This is a project that i have fallen in love with since i love seeing windows users discovering the beauty and efficency of a linux machine first hand. And personaly as a beta tester for this new linux laptop i think my productivity went up tenfold.
#### Cyberark
And i also been working on Cyberark systems to provide security to linux servers as well as windows in our infrastructure. This is an ongoing project that just keeps growing for each year with new components and new integrations.
#### Homelab
I have a huge homelab consisting of kubernetes clusters running AWX,gitea,jenkins etc. Also multiple virtual machines running foreman, testvm's running diffrent webservers and databases for automation testing and tinkering. Also a few windows vm's for pentesting purposes and of course kali linux for that exact same reason.
