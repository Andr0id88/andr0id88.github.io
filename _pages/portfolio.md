## Projects
I have been a part of many minor and larger projects in the last years, here are some of the projects i have been a part of.
#### Redhat satellite
One of the significant projects I undertook was the independent setup of RedHat Satellite for over 1000 servers within the healthcare sector in Norway. This ongoing project requires continuous problem-solving and automation efforts as new teams and challenges emerge. The setup involved a combination of automation tools such as Puppet, Ansible, and shell scripts.
#### Redhat insights
As part of my responsibilities, I took the initiative to introduce RedHat Insights alongside Satellite to our organization. I have been consistently working to enhance the integration of the Insights service with our overall platform. The goal is to establish a secure environment that enables our security team and other stakeholders to promptly identify and address emerging threats.
#### Ansible automation platform
Currently, I am actively engaged in setting up the Ansible Automation Platform to offer a brand new service to all our employees. The plan involves integrating this platform with Satellite and Insights to provide an automated errata and remediation service for our Linux platform. Additionally, as part of the Ansible Automation Platform implementation, we are leveraging Ansible for automation across our entire infrastructure, including both Windows and Linux machines as well as network devices.
#### Linux work surface
When I initially joined NHN Linux, the concept of using Linux as an office computer seemed unattainable. However, I am proud to be part of a significant project that aims to change that perception. We are in the final stages of being able to offer Linux as a work laptop, with Satellite and Insights playing a crucial role in this endeavor. Personally, as a beta tester for this new Linux laptop, I have witnessed a remarkable increase in my productivity.
#### Cyberark
Another ongoing project I have been involved in is the implementation of Cyberark systems to enhance the security of both our Linux and Windows servers in the infrastructure. This project continues to expand each year, incorporating new components and integrations.
#### Homelab
In my personal capacity, I maintain an extensive homelab environment consisting of Kubernetes clusters running AWX, Gitea, Jenkins, and other tools. Additionally, I manage multiple virtual machines running Foreman, as well as test VMs with various web servers and databases for automation testing and experimentation. I also maintain a few Windows VMs as victims for my Kali Linux machine.
