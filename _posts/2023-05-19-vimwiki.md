# Intro
This guide shows how to install and setup your own vimviki page that serves these .md files on a local webserver that is easily accesible and pretty usefull.
There are multiple steps for getting this to work and some of them are optional.
This guide is written for users of I3 and is aimed for RHEL9 workstation, therefore some of the functionality might not work for other dekstop environments such as gnome etc.
Other distro's running i3 can use this guide to make it work but they will have to change the install of prerequisites to fit their packetmanager.
Setup of i3 and configuring dropdown menus for it is out of scope for this post but it will be documented at a later date.

# Prerequisites

To get started we need to install some programs that

```bash
sudo dnf install -y ruby ruby-devel rubygems
```

Make sure you have ruby that is version 2.1 or higher this is required for jekyll to work, and make sure gems was installed correctly:
```bash
ruby --version
ruby 2.5.9p229 (2021-04-05 revision 67939) [x86_64-linux]

gem -v
2.7.6.3
```

Install jekyll
```bash
gem install jekyll bundler
```
